🌟 **Welcome to Rushikesh's Code Corner!** 🌟

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Rushikesh Palav** — a Fullstack Developer primarily orchestrating web magic with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). If your app needs more `React`-ivity or your backend needs some `Node`-worthy structure, you've probably stumbled into the right repository.

Expect to find experiments in scalable web apps, attempts at pixel-perfect UIs, and the occasional frantic commit message at 3 AM.

👨‍💻 **About Me**

*   🎓 B.Tech in Computer Science graduate from Savitribai Phule Pune University.
*   🚀 Ex-Team Lead @ Tecmetaverse, where I guided a squad of 8 talented devs, turning coffee into code and client requirements into reality.
*   💡 Fluent in JavaScript (especially the React & Node.js dialects), MongoDB query voodoo, and the ancient art of CSS alignment.
*   💻 Obsessed with building performant, scalable MERN applications that (hopefully) don't break the internet.
*   ⚙️ Known for optimizing things – ask me about achieving 100 Lighthouse scores!
*   🎮 When I'm not wrangling code, you might find me:
    *   📚 Lost in the pages of a good book (Sci-Fi/Fantasy mostly).
    *   🍳 Attempting culinary greatness (or just making instant noodles look fancy).
    *   🏋️‍♂️ Lifting heavy things at the gym (debugging for my muscles).
    *   🗺️ Planning world domination in a strategy RPG.
    *   🎬 Deep into the latest anime season.

P.S. If my GitHub activity graph looks suspiciously flat, I'm likely either locked in an epic battle with a piece of legacy code, deep in a complex refactor, or... maybe... just maybe... AFK touching grass. Probably the code thing though.
